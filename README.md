# Patient Monitoring Device Interface Prototype
CMSC 437 - Summer 24
Project Definition

This project is a prototype for a patient monitoring device interface designed to simulate a user-friendly frontend for healthcare professionals. It includes basic functionality to view, manage, and simulate real-time vital sign data for multiple patients.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The prototype mimics features of an actual patient monitoring system used in clinical environments, such as:

- Displaying real-time waveform animations (e.g., ECG, EKG, capnography).
- Managing patient data through a web interface.
- Simulating device output visuals using `.gif` files.

## Features

- Interactive Homepage
  Displays waveform animations and placeholder patient monitoring metrics.

- Add New Patient Page 
  Basic form interface to simulate new patient entry.

- Patient List View  
  Static list of patients registered in the system.

- Medical Gifs for Visual Simulation 
  Includes animated `.gif` files (capno, ecg, ekg, pleth) to simulate live readings.
